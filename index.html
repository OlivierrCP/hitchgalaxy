<h3 style="color:white" >The verdict</h3>
<p style="color:white" >I chose the novel The hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy by Douglas Adams because it looked like an interesting book and Simon recommended it to me.  <br> It was a fun but hard book to read and i sometimes couldn’t follow what the story was about. <br> The book was hard to read sometimes because the story used a lot of difficult words and sentences. <br> I also liked the story because it had a lot of humor included with it and weird scenarios that you would’ve never thought would happen in a book like this. <br> For example, two programmers in the book made a supernatural computer with the purpose to calculate the answer the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything after they let the robot work for 7,5 million years the robot gave an answer “42” but didn’t know the question to 42 itself. <br> The parts that made the book hard to read was when they introduced new sections and they had to explain what’s happening and with what new kind of alien species they were talking. <br> Overall this book was really fun to read but kind of hard to get into. <br> I give this book a 7/10.
